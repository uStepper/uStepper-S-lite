* @brief      Function prototypes and definitions for the uStepper S-lite library
*
*             This file contains class and function prototypes for the library,
*             as well as necessary constants and global variables.
*
* @author     Thomas Hørring Olsen (thomas@ustepper.com)
*
*	\mainpage Arduino library for the uStepper S-lite Board
*	
*	This is the uStepper S-lite Arduino library, providing software functions for the different features of the uStepper S-lite board.
*
*	\par Features
*	The uStepper S-lite library contains the following features:
*	
*	- Second order acceleration profile, to provide smooth ramping of the speed and to avoid the motor stalling when demanding high speeds.
*	- Closed loop PID position controller
*	- Control of RC servo motors
*	- Measure the current position of the shaft (absolute, multiple revolutions)
*	- Measure the current speed of the motor 
*	- Stall detection for use in e.g. limit detection functionality 
*	
*	The library uses both timer one and timer three in order to function properly, meaning that unless the user of this library
*	can accept the loss of some functionality, these two timers are unavailable and the registers associated with these timers
*	should not be reconfigured.
*
*	Timer one is used for sampling the encoder in order to provide the ability to keep track of both the current speed and the
*	angle moved since the board was reset (or a new home position was configured). Also the drop-in features missed step detection and 
*	correction is done in this timer. 
*	
*	Timer three is used to calculate the stepper acceleration algorithm.  
* 
*	\par Installation
*	To install the uStepper S-lite library into the Arduino IDE, perform the following steps:
*
*	- Go to Sketch->Include Libraries->Manage Libraries... in the arduino IDE
*	- Search for "uStepper S-lite", in the top right corner of the "Library Manager" window
*	- Install uStepper S-lite library 
*	
*	The library is tested with Arduino IDE 1.8.12
*	
*	\warning MAC users should be aware, that OSX does NOT include FTDI VCP drivers, needed to upload sketches to the uStepper S-lite, by default. This driver should be 
*	downloaded and installed from FTDI's website:
*	\warning http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm
*	\warning             The uStepper S-lite should NOT be connected to the USB port while installing this driver !
*	\warning This is not (commonly) a problem for windows/linux users, as these drivers are most often already included in the OS
*
*	\par Theory
*
*	The acceleration profile implemented in this library is a second order profile, meaning that the stepper will accelerate with a constant acceleration, the velocity will follow
*	a linear function and the position will look like an S-curve (it will follow a linear function at top speed and a second order function during acceleration and deceleration).
*	As a result, the position of the stepper motor will have continous and differentiable first and second derivatives.
*
*	The second order acceleration profile can be illustrated as follows (<a rel="license" href="http://picprog.strongedge.net/step_prof/step-profile.html">Source</a>):
*
*	\image html dva.gif
*
*	From the above picture it can be seen how the motor moves with this second order acceleration profile. The postion is depicted as orange, velocity as red and the acceleration as green.
